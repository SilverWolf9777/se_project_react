# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user. Has the ability for people to add their own clothes and weather recommendation. It has the ability to tell them the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit

The project uses its own mock backend api using json-server --watch db.json --id \_id --port 3001 in the terminal

- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React-Router
